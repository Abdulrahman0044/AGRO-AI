# AGRI-AI
An agricultural information source that incorporates AI tools aiming to improve productivity and promote sustainable agricultural practices. 

# Technologies Used
Generative AI - Using OpenAI's davinci model to generate agricultural suggestions based on a given prompt.
Computer Vision - Using an AI model built  to identify plant diseases and pests. Using Keras and Tensorflow.
Natural Language Processing - Using NLTK to analyze text and extract keywords to be used as prompts for the generative AI model.
Web Development - Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a website that incorporates the AI models.

# How to Run
The project is currently hosted on Streamlit Cloud at https://share.streamlit.io/agri-ai/main/app.py

To run the project locally, clone the repository and run the following commands in the terminal:

Streamlit run app.py
